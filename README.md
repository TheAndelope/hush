## üéÆ **Inspiration**

Our biggest inspiration for this project came from three key sources:

- The **Netflix hit film "A Quiet Place"**, where silence and stealth are essential for survival.
- **Classic survival horror games** like *Silent Hill*, known for their eerie atmospheres and tension-building gameplay.
- **The stylistic choices of PlayStation 1 games**, particularly pixelated and low-resolution graphics, which we used to create a nostalgic horror experience.

We chose **Unity** to develop this game as it provided an accessible platform for all of our team members, allowing us to dive into game development for the first time.

## üïπÔ∏è **What It Does**

This is a **PlayStation 1-inspired horror game** where players navigate a dark environment to escape a tracking AI enemy. The game's most unique mechanic is its **noise recognition** system:

- **Noise Detection**: If you talk too loudly, the monster will hear you and start tracking your location. Keep quiet to avoid being detected.
- **AI Tracking**: The AI enemy tracks the player based on noise, adding a layer of tension where stealth is key.
- **Escape Mechanics**: Keys to escape are hidden throughout the environment, but the monster will be drawn toward any sounds you make.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How We Built It**

We developed the game using **Unity** and **C#** for scripting, integrating **GitHub** for version control. The game features:

- **Noise Recognition**: The core gameplay mechanic of noise detection and enemy tracking.
- **AI Enemy**: A system that lets the enemy detect the player's location based on noise and movements.
- **Player Movement**: Movement controls that require stealth to avoid detection by the enemy.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenges We Ran Into**

Throughout the hackathon, we encountered several major setbacks:

1. **GitHub Integration**: Setting up GitHub and syncing our work with Unity was difficult and time-consuming.
2. **Character Model Issues**: Our character models would disappear after each commit, which was frustrating and costly in terms of time.
3. **Merge Conflicts**: On the final day, a merge conflict wiped out most of our code. Fortunately, one member had not pulled the update and was able to help us recover by creating a new Git repository.

## üìö **What We Learned**

- **Start with Git**: We initially worked without a Git repository, leading to major issues later on. It's essential to set up version control from the start.
- **Frequent Commits**: Committing frequently would have avoided the merge conflicts that caused us to lose significant work.

## üéß **Audio-Driven Gameplay**

One of the most important features of our game is the **audio-driven gameplay**. The core mechanic is that if the player **talks too loudly or makes noise**, the monster will hear them. The game uses this mechanic to create a **stealth experience**, where the player must balance exploration with remaining silent. Speaking too loudly can trigger the enemy‚Äôs tracking system, increasing the challenge and tension in the game.

## üìà **Future Improvements**

- **Refined AI**: We plan to make the AI's response to noise more realistic and challenging.
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Additional features, like puzzles or alternate escape routes, would add more depth to the gameplay.
- **Sound Effects**: Enhance the environmental sound design to make the audio recognition system even more immersive.
